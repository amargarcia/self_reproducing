Produce a self-replicating program (running the program produces as output the original source code). 
The output should compile and run and produce the identical output once again. You will need to capture 
the output some way (perhaps file redirection from the command prompt), then compare that output to the 
original source code with a file diff tool. The original and the captured output must be identical.
